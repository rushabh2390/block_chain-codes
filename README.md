## Introduction to BlockChain

### What is Blockchain?
---
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.

### Key element of Blockchain
---
- Distributed ledger technology
    - Distributed ledger contains immutable records of transactions. 
    - All pariticipants in network have access to this.(shared ledger)
    - Transactions are recorded only once.
    - Ledger is replicated in many nodes in network. rather then store in center one(That why its called Distributed ledger)
- Immutable records
    - Once trasnactions recorded in ledger no one can alter or tamper it.
    - If transaction recorded with error, new transaction must be added to reverse or correct the errors. These 2 transactions then would be visible.
- Smart contracts.
    - They are essentially scripts or programs that automatically enforce the rules and terms set within them.
    - They are little programs that execute ```if this happens then do that```, run and verified by many computers to ensure trustworthiness.
    - After deployment smart contract cannot be altered, ensuring the terms remains consistent and secure.
